Without further ado, let’s dive in.\nIntroduction In an earlier post, we familiarised ourselves with the notion of reductions. Towards the end, we introduced the notion of self-reducibility which is our main topic of focus today. We start by familiarising ourselves with a few concepts.\nPreliminaries Readers familiar with concepts such as Decision problems, Search Problems, and complexity classes TFNP, PPAD, PLS, etc. can skip this section.\nLanguages: In the world of complexity and computability, a language is a set of strings formed out of some alphabet. Formally, $L\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*}$, where the alphabet $\\Sigma$ is a finite set of symbols, and $\\Sigma^{*}$ refers to the Kleene closure of $\\Sigma$. Last time we formalized reductions in terms of Turing Machines. We now explicitly define mapping reductions (equivalent to Karp reductions for TMs) in terms of languages. Let $L_1 \\subseteq \\Sigma_1^{*}$ and $L_2 \\subseteq \\Sigma_2^{*}$ be languages. Recall that $L_1\\leq_m L_2$ (or, $L_1$ reduces to $L_2$), if there exists a computable function $f: \\Sigma_1^{*}\\mapsto\\Sigma_2^{*}$ s.t. for every $w\\in\\Sigma_1^{*}$, $w\\in L_1\\iff f(w)\\in L_2$. We sometimes use the notation $A\\leq^p_m B$ to denote that the function $f$ is polynomial time constructible.\nDecision Problems: A decision problem is a Boolean-valued function $f:\\Sigma^{*}\\mapsto\\{0,1\\}$. Every language $L\\subseteq\\Sigma^{*}$ can be uniquely associated with a unique decision problem called the membership problem. Here, $x\\in L\\iff f(x)=1$. A Turing machine $T$ computes/solves the decision problem $f$ if for any input $x\\in\\Sigma^{*}$, $T$ halts on any input $x$ and produces output $T(x)=f(x)$.\nHence problems themselves can be construed as languages.\nComplexity classes P and NP are defined w.r.t. decision problems.\nSearch Problems: A search problem is a relation $R\\subset\\Sigma_{in}^{*}\\times\\Sigma_{out}^{*}$, i.e., $(x,y)\\in R$, where $x\\in\\Sigma_{in},y\\in\\Sigma_{out}$ are strings belonging to the input and output alphabets respectively. Search problems are also known as relational problems / optimization problems. $R\\subset\\Sigma_{in}^{*}\\times\\Sigma_{out}^{*}$ is a polynomially-balanced relation if for any $(x,y)\\in R$, $|y|=\\text{poly}(|x|)$. A Turing machine $T$ computes/solves $R$, if for any input $x\\in\\Sigma_{in}$, $T(x)$ halts and produces $y\\in\\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\\in R$. Since the complexity class NP is defined w.r.t. decision problems, we need to introduce an equivalent notion for search problems. Informally, this is denoted by the class FNP (or Function NP). Formally, a polynomially-balanced relation $R$ defines a NP search problem if $R$ is polynomial-time computable.\nComplexity class TFNP: The complexity class TFNP consists of all search problems in FNP that are total in the sense that a solution is guaranteed to exist. In other words, $R\\in$TFNP$\\iff R\\in$FNP and $R$ is total, i.e., $\\forall x\\in\\Sigma_{in}, \\exists y\\in\\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\\in R$. It is straightforward to show that TFNP = FNP $\\cap$ co-FNP. It is not believed that TFNP has complete problems since it is a semantic class 1, and various syntactic subclasses have been used to classify the many diverse problems that belong to TFNP. The syntactic subclasses are defined based on the combinatorial principle used to argue totality in TFNP.\nEach subclass of TFNP has a corresponding existence proof principle (for example, an instance of a circuit or graph), one that when applied in a general context, does not yield a polynomial-time algorithm. We define two important subclasses of TFNP below (along with a whole host of others in the footnotes section.)\nComplexity class PLS: Also known as Polynomial Local Search, this is a subclass of TFNP function problems which contains problems that are guaranteed to have a solution because of the lemma that “every finite directed acyclic graph has a sink.” PLS captures problems of finding a local minimum of an objective function $f$, in contexts where any candidate solution $x$ has a local neighbourhood within which we can readily check for the existence of some other point having a lower value of $f$. One of the motivations behind defining PLS was to capture the notion of local optimum in NP-hard problems like TSP.\nComplexity class PPAD: PPAD is defined as the set of functions in TFNP that reduce in polynomial time to the End-Of-Line (EOL) problem.2 A problem is complete for PPAD if it belongs to PPAD and if EOL reduces in polynomial time to that problem. PPAD is contained in PPA $\\cap$ PPP 34 and could be regarded as the directed version of the class PPA.3\nSome interesting search/optimization problems that belong to the classes PPAD and PLS are described below.\nThe problem of finding a Nash equilibrium (NASH) in a normal form game of two or more players with specified utilities, is in PPAD. NASH with three players is PPAD-complete. Computing fixed-points in Brouwer functions5 is in PPAD. Gradient Descent is in CLS = PPAD $\\cap$ PLS.67 Search to Decision Reductions We note here that Decision Problems answer the following flavour of questions:\nGiven a problem $P$, is $x$ a solution to $P$? (Yes/No).\nOn the other hand, Search Problems answer the following flavour of questions:\nGiven a problem $P$, output a solution to $P$ with some property.\nFor example, given a problem $P$, output a solution to $P$ that has the minimum length. We use the satisfiability problem (SAT) as an example to further illustrate the two notions:\nDecision problem: Given a propositional formula $\\phi$, decide if $\\phi$ is satisfiable. Search problem: Given a propositional formula $\\phi$, find a satisfying assignment for $\\phi$. Note that SATSearch $\\in$ FNP but SATSearch $\\notin$ TFNP, since a formula may be unsatisfiable.\nAs we see above, if it is easy to solve the Search version of a problem $P$, it is straightforward to solve the Decision version of $P$. The more challenging question is:\nCan we efficiently solve the Search version of a problem $P$, if we know how to solve the Decision version of $P$ efficiently?\nFormally, let $O_D^p$ be a decision oracle for a search problem $R\\subset\\Sigma_{in}^{*}\\times\\Sigma_{out}^{*}$ s.t. querying $O_D^p$ produces $\\mathbb{I}[ \\exists x\\in\\Sigma_{in};|; x \\text{ has property } p]$; i.e., querying $O_D$ with an appropriate parameter for a property $p$ outputs a yes or a no indicating if there exists any input that satisfies the property $p$ (usually taken to be some bound on the input size). Our goal now is to produce $y\\in\\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\\in R$, using oracle calls to $O_D^p$.\nExamples of Search-to-Decision reduction In this section, we see some examples of search-to-decision reductions. Let us start with designing a search-to-decision reduction for SAT, which is an NP-complete problem.\nThere are two inputs to the SATSearchToDecision() reduction\nthe propositional formula $\\phi$ or f, and the decision oracle for SAT on $O_D$ or DSAT(f,assign) which takes as input a propositional formula f and a restricted assignment assign and returns yes iff f is satisfiable under the restriction assign. The output of the SATSearchToDecision() procedure is a satisfying assignment for $\\phi$( or f). SATSearchToDecision(f,DSAT()){ assignarr = [*,*,....,*];// Intitalize assignarr as an n-bit empty array. if(DSAT(f,assignarr)=0) // is f satisfiable without restrictions? return -1; // f is not satisfiable for (i=1;i\u003c=n; i++){ assignarr[i]= 0 //Fix the ith bit in x to be 1. // This fixes the ith literal in f. if (DSAT(f,assignarr)==1) continue; // move on to the i+1th coordinate, // with the ith bit set to 0. assignarr[i]= 1 //Fix the ith bit in x to be 0. // This fixes the ith literal in f. if (DSAT(f,assignarr)==1) continue; // move on to the i+1th coordinate, // with the ith bit set to 1. return assignarr; } Earlier we saw that the property used by the decision oracle was a restricted assignment. We list another example of a search-to-decision reduction for the Clique problem (another one of Karp’s original 21 NP-complete problems), to give a flavour of a different decision oracle property - based on size.\nThe Clique Decision problem: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, decide if $G$ contains a clique of size $\\leq k$. The Clique Search problem: Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, find a clique of size $\\leq k$ in $G$ if it exists. As seen above, there are two inputs to the CliqueSearchToDecision() reduction:\nthe graph $G$ as an adjacency list L, and the decision oracle for Clique on $O_D$ or DCLIQUE(L,k) which takes as input a adjacency list L and a parameter k and returns yes iff the graph corresponding to L contains a clique of size at most k. The output of the CliqueSearchToDecision() procedure is an adjacency list corresponding to a clique in $G$ of size $\\leq k$. Recall that an adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. We use the following definition of adjacency lists (this is a modification of the definition given in CLRS): An adjacency list is a singly linked list where each element in the list corresponds to a particular vertex, and each element in the list itself points to a singly linked list of the neighboring vertices of that vertex. See the diagram below.\nSATSearchToDecision(L,DCLIQUE()){ if(DCLIQUE(L,k)=0) return -1; // There is no clique of size at most k for every vertex v of G { Let Lv be the new adjacency list obtained by removing vertex v from G. // easily done using the above datastructure. if(DCLIQUE(Lv,k)=1) L = Lv; // update the graph to reflect G = G-v. } return L; } Above we saw examples of problems where both search and decision verions are hard. There exist problems where both the search and decision versions are easy, for example, Maximum Matching, Shortest Path, etc. A typical example of a problem where the decision version is easy and while the search version is supposedly hard is as follows:\nThe Decision problem (Primality testing): Given a natural number $n$, decide if $n$ is prime. The Search problem (Factoring): Given (the binary representation of) a natural number $n$, produce all of its factors. Note that unlike SATSearch and CliqueSearch, Factoring$\\in$TFNP since any natural number will always have at least two factors.\nMany important classes of cryptosystems such as RSA 8 depend on the hardness of the Factoring Search problem.9 The Factoring Decision problem is also known as the Primality testing problem.10\nFormal notion of Self-reducibility We now move on to the main topic of this post - the notion of self-reducibility (also known as auto-reducibility). A problem is self-reducible if it admits an efficient search-to-decision reduction, i.e., any efficient solution to the decision version of the problem implies an efficient solution to the search version of the problem.\nNote: Not every problem in NP is necessarily self-reducible. If EE$\\neq$NEE, then there exists a language in NP that is not self-reducible (Bellare and Goldwasser'94).11\nDownward self-reducibility A search problem $R$ is downward self-reducible (d.s.r) if there is a polynomial time oracle algorithm for $R$ that on input $x \\in \\Sigma^{*}$ makes queries to an $R$-oracle of size strictly less than $|x|$. In other words, a language $L$ is d.s.r. if there exists a polynomial time algorithm $A^O$ deciding $x\\overset{?}{\\in} L$ with a membership oracle $O$ for $L$ that can handle subqueries for strings $z\\overset{?}{\\in} L$ s.t. $|z|\u003c|x|$.\nWe can extend the notion of downward self-reducibility to functions or decision problems as follows: A function $f:\\Sigma^{*}\\mapsto \\{0,1\\}$ is downward self-reducible if there exists a polynomial time algorithm $A^{O_f}$ s.t. on any input of length $n$, $A$ only makes queries of length $ It is easy to see that SAT is d.s.r. since given any formula $\\phi$ on $n$-variables, one can consider only querying on restrictions of $\\phi$ to figure out if $\\phi$ is satisfiable.\nAll NP-complete decision problems are downward self-reducible.\nThis is straightforward to show using the fact that there exists a Karp-reduction from SAT to $L$ for any NP-complete problem $L$.\nEvery downward self-reducible decision problem is in PSPACE.\nProof. Let the input to a d.s.r. problem $f$ be $x$. Then any algorithm $A$ that solves $f$ will make queries to some oracle and recursively compute the answer to each query. The depth of the recursion is at most |x|, and at each level of recursion, the algorithm needs to remember the state which requires space at most poly(|x|). This last point holds because the basic computation runs in polynomial time, and hence polynomial space.\nNote: We also recall that PSPACE is closed 12 under Karp-reductions. Since, all d.s.r. languages belong to PSPACE, we can conclude that PSPACE is hard (worst-case or average-case) iff a d.s.r. language is hard (in the same sense.)\nEvery downward self-reducible search problem in TFNP is in PLS. 13\nHence PLS is in some senses the functional analogue of PSPACE. Harsha et al. (2023) 13 also show that most natural PLS-complete problems are downward self-reducible. We end with an important open question by Harsha et al. (2023) 13:\nIs Factoring downward self reducible?\nIf Factoring is downward self-reducible, then Factoring$\\in$UEOPL$\\subseteq$PPAD$\\cap$PLS 13. The complexity class UniqueEOPL (Unique End of Potential Line) captures search problems with the property that their solution space forms an exponentially large line with increasing cost.14 From one candidate solution we can calculate another candidate solution in polynomial time. The end of that line is the (unique) solution of the search problem. This implies that no efficient factoring algorithm exists using the factorization of smaller numbers.\nAn application of Downward Self-Reductions: Mahaney’s Theorem A language $L$ is (polynomially) sparse if it the number of strings of length $n$ in $L$ is bounded by a polynomial in $n$.\n[Mahaney’s Theorem] Assuming P $\\neq$ NP, there are no sparse NP-complete languages.\nProof Sketch: Recall the d.s.r tree of SAT. Given a SAT formula $\\phi[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]$ at the first level we can restrict the formula to $\\phi_0[0,\\ldots,x_n]$ and $\\phi_1[1,\\ldots,x_n]$. If $\\phi$ is satisfiable, then at least one of $\\phi_0$ or $\\phi_1$ is satisfiable. Hence, at the $\\ell$th level, at least one of the $2^{\\ell}$ formulas have to be satisfiable for the original formula to be satisifable. If $L$ is a sparse NP-complete language, we have $SAT\\leq^p_m L$. Hence, using a mapping reduction from SAT to $L$, we can prune the d.s.r. tree s.t. at the $\\ell$th level to only contend with $\\text{poly}(\\ell)$ formulas. This straightforwarly yields a polynomial time SAT algorithm, since there are only $n$ levels. This violates the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and therefore there does not exist any $L$ that is both sparse and NP-complete.\nThe above proof sketch is due to Joshua Grochow15, who credits Manindra Agrawal for the original idea.\nWhat’s Next? We have looked at self-reducibility and downward self-reducibility. In follow-up posts, we will introduce the notions of randomized reductions, random self-reducibility, and pseudorandom self-reducibility.\nA complexity class is called a semantic class if the Turing Machine (TM) defining this class has a property that is undecidable. See Papadimitrou’s original paper and this Stackexchange link for a more formal discussion on this topic. In a nutshell, promise classes such as RP, ZPP, BPP are semantic. ↩︎\nEOL is the class of problems which can be reduced to the EOL problem instance: Given a exponentially large directed graph consisting of lines and cycles on the vertex set $[2^𝑛]$, find any sink of the graph assuming vertex 1 is the source and every vertex has in and out degree at most 1. ↩︎\nComplexity class PPA: Also known as Polynomial Parity Argument, this class captures computational problems whose totality is rooted in the handshaking lemma for undirected graph: “all graphs of maximum degree 2 have an even number of leaves.” More precisely, PPA captures search problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given any string, computes its ’neighbor’ strings (of which there are at most two). Then given a leaf string (i.e. one with only one neighbor), the problem is to output another leaf string. ↩︎ ↩︎\nThe existence of solutions for problems in complexity class PPP: (also known as Polynomial Pigeonhole Principle) is guaranteed by the pigeonhole principle: if $n$ balls are placed in $m \u003c n$ bins then at least one bin must contain more than one ball. ↩︎\nBrouwer’s fixed-point theorem states that for any continuous function $f$ mapping a nonempty compact convex set to itself, there is a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$. ↩︎\nFinding a point where Gradient Descent terminates is equivalent to finding a KKT point—when the domain is bounded. Computing a KKT point of a continuously differentiable function over $[0, 1]^2$ is PPAD $\\cap$ PLS-complete. ↩︎\nThe EOL class is a combinatorially defined alternative to the complexity class CLS (Continuous Local Search), which contains Gradient Descent and various fixed point problems. CLS is the smallest known subclass of TFNP not known to be in P, and hardness results for it imply hardness results for PPAD and PLS simultaneously. ↩︎\nThe RSA problem: Find $M$ given the public key $(n,e)$ and a cipher text $C\\equiv M^e\\mod n$. ↩︎\nIf we can solve the factoring problem then we can solve the RSA problem by factoring the modulus n. Hence, Factoring $\\implies$ RSA. ↩︎\nThe seminal result of Agarwal, Kayal, and Saxena showed that this problem is in P. See this writeup for more details on the result. ↩︎\nEE equals DTIME($2^{2^{O(n)}}$). ↩︎\nWe recall the notion of notion of complete problems here. ↩︎\nPrahladh Harsha, Daniel Mitropolsky, and Alon Rosen.

Towards the end, we introduced the notion of <strong>self-reducibility</strong> which is our main topic of focus today. We start by familiarising ourselves with a few concepts.</p><h2 id=preliminaries>Preliminaries<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#preliminaries>#</a></h2><p><em>Readers familiar with concepts such as Decision problems, Search Problems, and complexity classes TFNP, PPAD, PLS, etc. can skip this section.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Languages:</strong> In the world of complexity and computability, a language is a set of strings formed out of some alphabet. Formally, $L\subseteq\Sigma^{*}$, where the alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite set of symbols, and $\Sigma^{*}$ refers to the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene_star#Definition>Kleene closure</a> of $\Sigma$.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Last time we formalized reductions in terms of Turing Machines. We now explicitly define mapping reductions (equivalent to Karp reductions for TMs) in terms of languages. Let $L_1 \subseteq \Sigma_1^{*}$ and $L_2 \subseteq \Sigma_2^{*}$ be languages. Recall that $L_1\leq_m L_2$ (or, $L_1$ reduces to $L_2$), if there exists a computable function $f: \Sigma_1^{*}\mapsto\Sigma_2^{*}$ s.t. for every $w\in\Sigma_1^{*}$, $w\in L_1\iff f(w)\in L_2$. We sometimes use the notation $A\leq^p_m B$ to denote that the function $f$ is polynomial time constructible.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Decision Problems:</strong> A decision problem is a Boolean-valued function $f:\Sigma^{*}\mapsto\{0,1\}$.</li></ul><p>Every language $L\subseteq\Sigma^{*}$ can be uniquely associated with a unique decision problem called the <strong>membership problem</strong>. Here, $x\in L\iff f(x)=1$. A Turing machine $T$ computes/solves the decision problem $f$ if for any input $x\in\Sigma^{*}$, $T$ halts on any input $x$ and produces output $T(x)=f(x)$.</p><blockquote><p>Hence problems themselves can be construed as languages.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Complexity classes <strong>P</strong> and <strong>NP</strong> are defined w.r.t. decision problems.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Search Problems:</strong> A search problem is a relation $R\subset\Sigma_{in}^{*}\times\Sigma_{out}^{*}$, i.e., $(x,y)\in R$, where $x\in\Sigma_{in},y\in\Sigma_{out}$ are strings belonging to the input and output alphabets respectively. Search problems are also known as relational problems / optimization problems.<ul><li>$R\subset\Sigma_{in}^{*}\times\Sigma_{out}^{*}$ is a polynomially-balanced relation if for any $(x,y)\in R$, $|y|=\text{poly}(|x|)$.</li><li>A Turing machine $T$ computes/solves $R$, if for any input $x\in\Sigma_{in}$, $T(x)$ halts and produces $y\in\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\in R$.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Since the complexity class <strong>NP</strong> is defined w.r.t. decision problems, we need to introduce an equivalent notion for search problems. Informally, this is denoted by the class <strong>FNP</strong> (or Function <strong>NP</strong>). Formally, a polynomially-balanced relation $R$ defines a NP search problem if $R$ is polynomial-time computable.</p><ul><li><strong>Complexity class TFNP:</strong> The complexity class TFNP consists of all search problems in FNP that are total in the sense that a solution is guaranteed to exist. In other words, $R\in$<strong>TFNP</strong>$\iff R\in$<strong>FNP</strong> and $R$ is total, i.e., $\forall x\in\Sigma_{in}, \exists y\in\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\in R$. It is straightforward to show that <strong>TFNP</strong> = <strong>FNP</strong> $\cap$ <strong>co-FNP</strong>.</li></ul><blockquote><p>It is not believed that <strong>TFNP</strong> has complete problems since it is a semantic class <sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, and various syntactic subclasses have been used to classify the many diverse problems that belong to <strong>TFNP</strong>. The syntactic subclasses are defined based on the combinatorial principle used to argue totality in <strong>TFNP</strong>.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p>Each subclass of TFNP has a corresponding existence proof principle (for example, an instance of a circuit or graph), one that when applied in a general context, does not yield a polynomial-time algorithm. We define two important subclasses of TFNP below (along with a whole host of others in the footnotes section.)</p><ul><li><strong>Complexity class PLS:</strong> Also known as Polynomial Local Search, this is a subclass of TFNP function problems which contains problems that are guaranteed to have a solution because of the lemma that &ldquo;every finite directed acyclic graph has a sink.&rdquo;</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>PLS</strong> captures problems of finding a local minimum of an objective function $f$, in contexts where any candidate solution $x$ has a local neighbourhood within which we can readily check for the existence of some other point having a lower value of $f$. One of the motivations behind defining PLS was to capture the notion of local optimum in <strong>NP-hard problems</strong> like TSP.</p></blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>Complexity class PPAD:</strong> <strong>PPAD</strong> is defined as the set of functions in <strong>TFNP</strong> that reduce in polynomial time to the End-Of-Line (EOL) problem.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> A problem is complete for <strong>PPAD</strong> if it belongs to <strong>PPAD</strong> and if <strong>EOL</strong> reduces in polynomial time to that problem.

(Yes/No).</p></blockquote><p>On the other hand, Search Problems answer the following flavour of questions:</p><blockquote><p>Given a problem $P$, output a solution to $P$ with some property.</p></blockquote><p>For example, given a problem $P$, output a solution to $P$ that has the minimum length. We use the satisfiability problem (SAT) as an example to further illustrate the two notions:</p><ul><li><strong>Decision problem:</strong> Given a propositional formula $\phi$, decide if $\phi$ is satisfiable.</li><li><strong>Search problem:</strong> Given a propositional formula $\phi$, find a satisfying assignment for $\phi$.</li></ul><p>Note that SATSearch $\in$ <strong>FNP</strong> but SATSearch $\notin$ <strong>TFNP</strong>, since a formula may be unsatisfiable.</p><p>As we see above, if it is easy to solve the Search version of a problem $P$, it is straightforward to solve the Decision version of $P$. The more challenging question is:</p><blockquote><p>Can we efficiently solve the Search version of a problem $P$, if we know how to solve the Decision version of $P$ efficiently?</p></blockquote><p>Formally, let $O_D^p$ be a decision oracle for a search problem $R\subset\Sigma_{in}^{*}\times\Sigma_{out}^{*}$ s.t. querying $O_D^p$ produces $\mathbb{I}[ \exists x\in\Sigma_{in};|; x \text{ has property } p]$; i.e., querying $O_D$ with an appropriate parameter for a <em>property</em> $p$ outputs a yes or a no indicating if there exists any input that satisfies the property $p$ (usually taken to be some bound on the input size). Our goal now is to produce $y\in\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\in R$, using oracle calls to $O_D^p$.</p><h3 id=examples-of-search-to-decision-reduction>Examples of Search-to-Decision reduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#examples-of-search-to-decision-reduction>#</a></h3><p>In this section, we see some examples of search-to-decision reductions.

We list another example of a search-to-decision reduction for the Clique problem (another one of Karp&rsquo;s original 21 <strong>NP-complete</strong> problems), to give a flavour of a different decision oracle property - based on size.</p><ul><li><strong>The Clique Decision problem:</strong> Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, decide if $G$ contains a clique of size $\leq k$.</li><li><strong>The Clique Search problem:</strong> Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, find a clique of size $\leq k$ in $G$ if it exists.</li></ul><p>As seen above, there are two inputs to the <code>CliqueSearchToDecision()</code> reduction:</p><ul><li>the graph $G$ as an adjacency list <code>L</code>, and</li><li>the decision oracle for Clique on $O_D$ or <code>DCLIQUE(L,k)</code> which takes as input a adjacency list <code>L</code> and a parameter <code>k</code> and returns yes iff the graph corresponding to <code>L</code> contains a clique of size at most <code>k</code>.

A problem is self-reducible if it admits an efficient search-to-decision reduction, i.e., any efficient solution to the decision version of the problem implies an efficient solution to the search version of the problem.</p><blockquote><p>Note: Not every problem in NP is necessarily self-reducible.

In other words, a language $L$ is d.s.r. if there exists a polynomial time algorithm $A^O$ deciding $x\overset{?}{\in} L$ with a membership oracle $O$ for $L$ that can handle subqueries for strings $z\overset{?}{\in} L$ s.t. $|z|&lt;|x|$.</p><blockquote><p>We can extend the notion of downward self-reducibility to <em>functions</em> or decision problems as follows: A function $f:\Sigma^{*}\mapsto \{0,1\}$ is downward self-reducible if there exists a polynomial time algorithm $A^{O_f}$ s.t. on any input of length $n$, $A$ only makes queries of length $&lt;n$ to the membership oracle ${O_f}$, and for every input $x$, $A^{O_f}(x)=f(x)$.</p></blockquote><p>It is easy to see that SAT is d.s.r. since given any formula $\phi$ on $n$-variables, one can consider only querying on restrictions of $\phi$ to figure out if $\phi$ is satisfiable.</p><blockquote><p>All <strong>NP-complete</strong> decision problems are downward self-reducible.</p></blockquote><p>This is straightforward to show using the fact that there exists a Karp-reduction from SAT to $L$ for any <strong>NP-complete</strong> problem $L$.</p><blockquote><p>Every downward self-reducible decision problem is in <strong>PSPACE</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Proof.</em> Let the input to a d.s.r. problem $f$ be $x$. Then any algorithm $A$ that solves $f$ will make queries to some oracle and recursively compute the answer to each query. The depth of the recursion is at most |x|, and at each level of recursion, the algorithm needs to remember the state which requires space at most poly(|x|).

Since, all d.s.r. languages belong to <strong>PSPACE</strong>, we can conclude that <strong>PSPACE</strong> is <strong>hard</strong> (worst-case or average-case) iff a d.s.r. language is <strong>hard</strong> (in the same sense.)</p><blockquote><p>Every downward self-reducible search problem in TFNP is in PLS. <sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Hence <strong>PLS</strong> is in some senses the functional analogue of <strong>PSPACE</strong>. Harsha et al. (2023) <sup id=fnref1:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup> also show that most natural <strong>PLS-complete</strong> problems are downward self-reducible.

Given a SAT formula $\phi[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ at the first level we can restrict the formula to $\phi_0[0,\ldots,x_n]$ and $\phi_1[1,\ldots,x_n]$. If $\phi$ is satisfiable, then at least one of $\phi_0$ or $\phi_1$ is satisfiable. Hence, at the $\ell$th level, at least one of the $2^{\ell}$ formulas have to be satisfiable for the original formula to be satisifable. If $L$ is a sparse NP-complete language, we have $SAT\leq^p_m L$. Hence, using a mapping reduction from SAT to $L$, we can prune the d.s.r. tree s.t. at the $\ell$th level to only contend with $\text{poly}(\ell)$ formulas. This straightforwarly yields a polynomial time SAT algorithm, since there are only $n$ levels. This violates the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis>Exponential Time Hypothesis</a>, and therefore there does not exist any $L$ that is both sparse and NP-complete.</p><p>The above proof sketch is due to Joshua Grochow<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>, who credits Manindra Agrawal for the original idea.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s Next?<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whats-next>#</a></h2><p>We have looked at self-reducibility and downward self-reducibility.
