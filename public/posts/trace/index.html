Funnily, the reason I even took the second course was because I was struggling the intuition behind certain concepts such as density matrices and measurements in basic quantum computing and quantum information theory!\nIn hindsight, the lack of a deep dive into topics like trace very early on is perhaps intended by design. The computational aspects of matrices such as determinants and invertibility are crucial to a lot of school-level and undergraduate cs, physics, and maths, while a first course in linear algebra is supposed to gently handhold your way as you make your own connections between abstract concepts like vector spaces and other subjects like abstract algebra and analysis. We start this post with the first time any student might run into a deep think about the notion of trace!\nThe Trace (First Definitions) Let us start with two definitions of trace, and a series of quizzes.\nDefinition 1 (Trace of a Linear Operator): Let $V$ be a vector space, and $A:V\\mapsto V$ be a linear operator 1 on $V$. The trace of $A$ is defined as $tr(A)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\lambda_i(A)$, where the $\\lambda_i(A)$’s are the eigenvalues of $A$.\nDefinition 2 (Trace of a Matrix): Let $M$ be an $n\\times n$ square matrix. The trace of $M$ is defined as $tr(M)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}M(i,i)$, where $M(i,j)$ is the $(i,j)$th entry of $M$. Hence the trace is the sum of diagonal entries of $M$.\nHere is a small exercise for the readers at this point: Let $V$ be finite-dimensional, and let $B_1$ and $B_2$ be two different bases of $V$ s.t. the corresponding matrix representations of $A$ are $M_1$ and $M_2$.2 Prove that $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}M_1(i,i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}M_2(i,i)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\lambda_i(A).$$\nIf you are struggling to prove the above statement in full generality, try assuming the following relaxations:\n$V$ is a finite-dimensional inner product space 3 (this gives us access to orthonormal bases), and $A$ is Hermitian with distinct eigenvalues (this gives us access to the Spectral Theorem4). Interestingly, these restrictions suffice for the purposes of quantum computation and quantum information theory. Proving the above equivalence in full generality is not straightforward (at least for me). We will prove the general version of the above equivalence later shortly.\nLet us pause at this moment and reflect on a few things. What does the above exercise actually tell us? Succintly put, under sufficiently well-behaved conditions (finite-dimensional operators/bounded operators), Definitions 1 and 2 are equivalent.\nNow for more pressing questions: What does the equivalence between Definitions 1 and 2 actually tell us? Most importantly it tells us that the trace of an operator is an invariant quantity, much like its determinant!\nWe digress for a moment to reflect on the geometric picture of the determinant of an operator. Consider any orthonormal basis $B$ of a finite-dimensional inner-product space $V$. One can visualise the action of an operator $A$ on $V$ as transforming the cube (of volume $1$) formed by the basis vectors into a parallelopiped. A geometric interpretation of the determinant of an operator $A$ is the (signed) volume of the parallelopiped formed by the transformed basis vectors under action of $A$. Since we started with the cube of normalized basis vectors with volume $1$, the determinant captures the amount of distortion induced by the operator $A$. Keeping in mind the above picture, here are two questions for the reader:\nWhat is the significance of the volume of the parallelopiped being signed? What is the geometric intepretation of non-invertible/singular operators? Unlike the determinant, however, it is not immediately clear to us what the physical/geometric interpretation of trace would be. Assuming that the operator has distinct eigenvectors, we know that each individual eigenvalue represents the scaling factor of the corresponding eigenvector. Can we build on this to understand what the sum of scaling factors is meant to represent? (If you do not know the answer, get some coffee and have a small think before continuing.)\nA third definition of the Trace We build up to this definition of trace by relating the eigenvalues of an operator to the entries of any of its matrix representation.\nLet $A$ be a linear operator on an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$. Let $B$ a basis of $V$ s.t. the matrix representation of $A$ w.r.t. $B$ is $M^A_B$. We denote this as $M$ or $M_B$ for brevity. Recall that the characteristic polynomial of $M$ is $P_A(M_B) = det(M_B - \\lambda I)$, s.t. the roots of $P_A(M_B)$ are the eigenvalues of $A$.\nNote that if $C$ is a different basis of $V$, then the matrix representation of $A$ w.r.t. $C$, denoted by $M_C$, then the matrices $M_B$ and $M_C$ are similar, i.e., there exists a matrix $S$ (precisely the change of basis matrix from $B$ to $C$), s.t. $M_B = S M_C S^{-1}$. Then, we have\n$P_A(M_C) = \\det(M_C - \\lambda I) = \\det(S\\cdot M_B\\cdot S^{-1} - S\\cdot \\lambda I\\cdot S^{-1})$ \u003e $\\implies P_A(M_C)= \\det(S\\cdot (M_B-\\lambda I)\\cdot S^{-1})$ \u003e $\\implies P_A(M_C)= \\det(S)\\cdot P_A(M_B)\\cdot\\det(S^{-1})$ \u003e $\\implies P_A(M_C)= P_A(M_B).$\nHence, the characteristic polynomial is invariant due to change of basis. This implies that the roots of the characteristic polynomial do not change, implying that the trace is invariant under basis change.\nThere still remains the question: Why is it related to the sum of diagonal elements?\n– second term, and the fact that two real-valued polynomials are (numerically) equal for all values of t if and only if their individual coefficients are equal\n$$p(t) = \\det(A-tI) = (-1)^n \\big(t^n - (\\text{tr} A) ,t^{n-1} + \\dots + (-1)^n \\det A\\big),.$$\nTrace is preserved under similarity and every matrix is similar to a Jordan block matrix.\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/72303/proving-the-trace-of-a-transformation-is-independent-of-the-basis-chosen\rTrace definition for orthonormal systems\nTrace for PSD\nTrace for others\nTrace of projectors\nLet $V$ be a vector spaces over some field $\\mathbb{F}$. A function $A:V\\mapsto V$ is a linear operator on $V$ if $\\forall \\lambda,\\sigma\\in\\mathbb{F}$ and $\\forall v,w\\in V$, $A(\\lambda v + \\sigma w) = \\lambda A(v) + \\sigma A(w)$. ↩︎\nA linear operator on an infinite-dimensional vector space will not have a matrix representation if it is not bounded. For the purposes of our discussion, requiring that $V$ is finite-dimensional suffices and also avoids unneccessary complications. ↩︎\nRecall that for general vector spaces, the only property of basis vectors available to us is linear independence. Sometimes, it is desirable if we could add more structure to the basis set. An inner product space is a vector space equipped with the notion of an inner product function. This allows us to capture the notion of angles between vectors. The immediate consequence of note is that we can define a set of orthonormal basis vectors for any vector space equipped with an inner product. ↩︎\nIf $A$ is a Hermitian operator (i.e., $A=A^{\\dagger}$) on a finite-dimensional vector space $W$, $A=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_i v_i^{\\dagger}\\cdot v_i$, where $\\lambda_i$ are real eigenvalues of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvectors $v_i$, which form an orthonormal basis of $V$. Note that the eigendecomposition of $A$ is not unique if the eigenvalues are not distinct. Equivalently, $A=V\\Lambda V^{\\dagger}$, where $V$ is a unitary matrix whose columns are $v_i$ and $\\lambda$ is the diagonal matrix with $\\lambda_i$ as its entries. ↩︎\n","wordCount":"1215","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-03-08T12:03:46+05:30","dateModified":"2025-03-08T12:03:46+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/trace/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Theoretickles","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Theoretickles (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Theoretickles</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">

Sometimes, it is desirable if we could add more structure to the basis set. An inner product space is a vector space equipped with the notion of an inner product function. This allows us to capture the notion of <em>angles</em> between vectors. The immediate consequence of note is that we can define a set of orthonormal basis vectors for any vector space equipped with an inner product.&#160;<a href=#fnref:3 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:4><p>If $A$ is a Hermitian operator (i.e., $A=A^{\dagger}$) on a finite-dimensional vector space $W$, $A=\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i v_i^{\dagger}\cdot v_i$, where $\lambda_i$ are real eigenvalues of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvectors $v_i$, which form an orthonormal basis of $V$. Note that the eigendecomposition of $A$ is not unique if the eigenvalues are not distinct. Equivalently, $A=V\Lambda V^{\dagger}$, where $V$ is a unitary matrix whose columns are $v_i$ and $\lambda$ is the diagonal matrix with $\lambda_i$ as its entries.&#160;<a href=#fnref:4
