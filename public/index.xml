      <description>QTML 2022 Once thought to be a niche curiosity, the field of QML is growing astoundingly fast. QTML, or &amp;lsquo;&amp;lsquo;Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; is an annual conference that caters to its eponymous field. The conference describes itself as &amp;lsquo;focused on the interplay between machine learning and quantum physics.&amp;rsquo; For an overview of various subfields of QML, check out this survey article by Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, and Seth Lloyd from 2017.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Reductions</title>

      <description>This post assumes basic familiarity with Turing machines, P, NP, NP-completeness, decidability, and undecidability. Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me via email if you need further clarification. Without further ado, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
Introduction Why do we need reductions? From Archimedes terrorizing the good folk of ancient Syracuse to Newton watching apples fall during a medieval plague, science has always progressed one &amp;lsquo;Eureka!&amp;rsquo; at a time. Romantic as these anecdotes may be, for mathematics, we can hardly look to Mother Nature for providing us the key insight to our proofs.</description>
