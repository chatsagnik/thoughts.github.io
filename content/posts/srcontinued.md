# Which search problems are (not) known to be self-reducible?

**The one-line asnwer:** Self-reducibility is precluded in cases where the decision version is easy while the search version is hard.

For example, consider the `Factoring` problem:

- **The Factoring Decision problem:** Given a natural number $n$, decide if $n$ is prime.
- **The Factoring Search problem:** Given (the binary representation of) a natural number $n$, produce all of its factors.

Many important classes of cryptosystems such as [RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_cryptosystem) [^R1] are based on the hardness of the `Factoring Search problem`.[^R2] On the other hand, the `Factoring Decision problem` (also known as the `Primality testing problem`) has long been known to computationally tractable.[^primality] Hence, `Factoring` does not appear to be straightforwardly self-reducible.

> If **EE** $\neq$ **NEE**, then there exists a language in **NP** that is not self-reducible.[^EE] **[Bellare and Goldwasser'94]**

Following the above result, Beame et al. (1998)[^beame98] showed the existence of various search problems in **FNP** that are not computationally equivalent to their decision versions. This is particularly important when a solution for the search problem is **guaranteed to exist** (but hard to find).

One of the research directions on the notion of self-reducible problems is to characterise their complexity. Even though decisional complexity is well understood at an undergraduate level, the complexity of search problems is strictly a graduate level topic due to the sheer amount of prerequisites involved. I will now attempt to provide an introduction to the complexity landscape of **NP**-search problems and state a few results connected to self-reducibility and downward-self-reducibility of search problems.

# Taxonomy of NP search problems

The complexity class **TFNP** consists of all search problems in **FNP** that are total in the sense that **a solution is guaranteed to exist**.

A straightforward example is an optimization problem over a domain such that every point in the domain is a feasible solution such as minimizing the function $(x-3)^2$ over $\mathbb{R}$.

Another interesting (nonstandard) example is finding the minimum cost permutation of a string. Given a cost function $c:[n]\mapsto\mathbb{R}$, find the permutation $\pi\in S_n$[^symmetric] that minimizes the cost function as follows: $\underset{\pi\in S_n}{\min} \sum_{i=1}^n c(i)\pi(i).$

For example, consider the cost $c=(1,0,2)$. The permutation $(2, 1, 3)$ has cost $8$, while the permutation $(1, 3, 2)$ has cost $5$. Notably, _every_ permutation has an associated cost, so as long as the output is a permutation, the solution to the above optimization problem is feasible.

More formally, $R\in$**TFNP**$\iff R\in$**FNP** and $R$ is total, i.e., $\forall x\in\Sigma_{in}, \exists y\in\Sigma_{out}$ s.t. $(x,y)\in R$.

Recall that `SATSearch` $\in$ **FNP**, but note that `SATSearch` $\notin$ **TFNP**, since a formula may be unsatisfiable. Using the totality property of **TFNP**, it is straightforward to show that **TFNP** $=$ **FNP** $\cap$ **coFNP**.

As we have seen in the case of decision problems, the notion of **NP-completeness** plays a huge role in establishing relative hardness results among many problems of interests, and has a beautiful relationship with the concept of reductions. One might naturally ask whether a similar connection might be made w.r.t. **FNP-complete** problems and self-reductions!

> If **NP** $\neq$ **coNP** there is no **FNP-complete** problem in **TFNP**.

Since we consider a **P** $\neq$ **NP** to be a reasonable assumption, it is very likely that **NP** $\neq$ **coNP**. What then is a notion of a _hard_ total search problem? In other words, how do we then characterize the hardness of efficiently verifiable total search problems?

Another way to look at this question is as follows: Can we formally provide examples of search problems that are (for some notion of hardness) the hardest in **TFNP**?

At this point, we list some interesting candidate computational problems known to be in **TFNP** that are not known to be in **FP**:

- `NASHx`: Finding a mixed Nash equilibrium of a game with $x$ players.
- `Brouwer`/`Kakutani`: Finding Brouwer/Kakutani fixed points for continuous functions.[^Brouwer][^Kakutani]
- `Factoring`: Finding a (or all) prime factors of a number $n\geq 2$.
- `SetCover`: Finding a minimum Set Cover.

> Do any of the above problems claim the crown of completeness in TFNP?

Unfortunately, it is believed that **TFNP** has [no complete problems](https://theoretickles.netlify.app/posts/reductions/#completeness) since it is a **semantic class**![^semantic]

Hence, in order to characterize the notion of hardness in total search problems, various syntactic subclasses have been defined in an attempt to classify the many diverse problems that belong to **TFNP**.

Recall that **TFNP** problems have the following two characteristics - **(a)** any solution can be checked efficiently _(the NP property)_, and **(b)** there always exists at least one solution _(the totality property)_. The syntactic subclasses are defined based on the combinatorial principle used to argue totality in **TFNP**. In other words, each subclass of **TFNP** has a corresponding existence proof principle (for example, an instance of a circuit or graph), _one that when applied in a general context, does not yield a polynomial-time algorithm_.

## Important subclasses of TFNP

We define two important subclasses of **TFNP** in this post: **PLS** and **PPAD** (along with a whole host of others in the footnotes section).

The complexity class **PLS** (also known as **Polynomial Local Search**), is a subclass of **TFNP** function problems which contains problems that are guaranteed to have a solution because of the lemma that "every finite directed acyclic graph has a sink."

> _Remark:_ The graph instance above may be exponentially large. For a finer intuition see the description of **EOL**[^EOL] in the footnotes.

**PLS** captures problems of finding a local minimum of an objective function $f$, in contexts where any candidate solution $x$ has a local neighbourhood within which we can readily check for the existence of some other point having a lower value of $f$. One of the motivations behind defining **PLS** was to capture the notion of problems with existing local optimum in **NP-hard problems** like `TSP`. Since a **PLS** problem always has a local optimum, it therefore always a solution (as the set of solutions is finite). Hence, using the above definitions, we have:

> **FP** $\subseteq$ **PLS** $\subseteq$ **TFNP** $\subseteq$ **FNP**.

**Remark:** From our discussions above, it may be unclear why search problems in **FP** have to be _total_. To see why, consider $R\in$ **FP** and fix a special string $y_0$ s.t. $\forall x\in\Sigma_{in}^{\*}$ s.t. $(x,y_0)\notin R$. An easy way to construct $y_0$ is to append every $y\in\Sigma_{out}^{\*}$ with a $1$, and set $y_0$ as the all zero string.

Examples of **PLS-complete problems** include search versions of `Set-Cover`, `Metric-TSP`, and `Weighted Independent-Set` (among many many others).

Another subclass of **TFNP** is the complexity class **PPAD**. **PPAD** is defined as the set of functions in **TFNP** that reduce in polynomial time to the `End-Of-Line (EOL)` problem.[^EOL] In other words, a problem is complete for **PPAD** if it belongs to **PPAD** and if **EOL** reduces in polynomial time to that problem. **PPAD** is contained in **PPA** $\cap$ **PPP** [^PPA][^PPP] and could be regarded as the directed version of the class **PPA**.[^PPA]

`NASH2` $\in$ **PPAD**, and `NASH3` is **PPAD-complete**. The `Brouwer` and `Kakutani` problems are also in **PPAD**.

Problems in **PLS** can be solved with local improvement algorithms, while problems in **PPAD** admit "optimality equations" that characterize solutions as fixed points.

> **PPAD** and **PLS** are believed to be strictly incomparable.[^beame98][^oppenheim]

The complexity class Continuous Local Search **CLS** = **PPAD** $\cap$ **PLS**.[^KKT][^CLS][^EOL] `Gradient Descent` is in **CLS**.

The following diagram ([appropriated from this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as720_SRpY0)) captures the above discussion in a nutshell.

## Complexity of downward-self-reducible search problems

[In an earlier post](https://theoretickles.netlify.app/posts/selfreductions) we saw that every downward self-reducible decision problem is in **PSPACE**. The following result was recently shown, as an analogue for search problems.

> Every downward self-reducible total search problem is in **PLS**. [^harsha23]

Hence **PLS** is in some senses the functional analogue of **PSPACE**. Harsha et al. (2023) [^harsha23] also show that most natural **PLS-complete** problems are downward self-reducible. We end with an important open question by Harsha et al. (2023) [^harsha23]:

> Is `Factoring` downward self reducible?

If `Factoring` is downward self-reducible, then `Factoring`$\in$**UEOPL**$\subseteq$**PPAD**$\cap$**PLS** [^harsha23].

The complexity class **UniqueEOPL** (Unique End of Potential Line) captures search problems with the property that their solution space forms an _exponentially_ large line with increasing cost.[^EOPL][^UEOPL] From one candidate solution we can calculate another candidate solution in polynomial time. The end of that line is the (unique) solution of the search problem. This implies (according to a whole host of complexity theoretic assumptions) that **no efficient factoring algorithm exists using the factorization of smaller numbers**.

# Footnotes

[^semantic]: A complexity class is called a **semantic class** if the Turing Machine (TM) defining this class has a property that is undecidable. See [Papadimitrou's original paper](https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~krajicek/papadim1.pdf) and [this Stackexchange link](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/1233/semantic-vs-syntactic-complexity-classes) for a more formal discussion on this topic. In a nutshell, promise classes such as **RP**, **ZPP**, **BPP** are semantic.
[^PPP]: The existence of solutions for problems in **complexity class PPP:** (also known as Polynomial Pigeonhole Principle) is guaranteed by the pigeonhole principle: if $n$ balls are placed in $m < n$ bins then at least one bin must contain more than one ball.
[^EOL]: **EOL** is the class of problems which can be reduced to the `EOL` problem instance: Given a exponentially large directed graph consisting of lines and cycles on the vertex set $[2^𝑛]$, find any sink of the graph assuming vertex 1 is the source and every vertex has in and out degree at most 1. Note that we overload the notation **EOL** to refer to both the problem and the complexity class.
[^CLS]: The **EOL** class is a combinatorially defined alternative to the complexity class **CLS** (Continuous Local Search), which contains Gradient Descent and various fixed point problems. **CLS** is the smallest known subclass of **TFNP** not known to be in **P**, and hardness results for it imply hardness results for **PPAD** and **PLS** simultaneously.
[^EOPL]: One interesting subclass of **EOL** is **End-Of-Potential-Line** (**EOPL**) where we add the following constraint addition to the `EOL` problem instance: we are also given a potential function that increases along each edge. It is known that the `EOPL` problem is complete for **PPAD** $\cap$ **PLS**. Hence **EOPL** = **CLS**, suggesting an equivalence between purely combinatorially defined search problems and real-valued continuous optimisation problems. [See this thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:67e2d80b-76bf-4b49-9b7d-8bbd91633dd7) for a detailed perspective on this equivalence.
[^UEOPL]:
    If the graph instance in the `EOPL` problem has a unique sink, then the problem (and the related complexity class) is known as **UEOPL**. It is an open question if the `UEOPL` is complete for **PPAD** $\cap$ **PLS**.[^harsha23]
    Once again, we note that we overload the notations **EOPL** and **UEOPL** to refer to both the problems and their corresponding complexity class.

[^Brouwer]: **Brouwer's fixed-point theorem** states that for any continuous function $f$ mapping a nonempty compact convex set to itself, there is a point $x_0$ such that $f(x_0)=x_0$.
[^Kakutani]: The **Kakutani fixed point theorem** is a generalization of the Brouwer fixed point theorem to set-valued functions. By [Weller's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weller%27s_theorem), Kakutani's fixed-point theorem is used in proving the existence of cake allocations that are both envy-free and Pareto efficient.
[^KKT]: Finding a point where Gradient Descent terminates is equivalent to finding a KKT point—when the domain is bounded. Computing a KKT point of a continuously differentiable function over $[0, 1]^2$ is complete for **PPAD** $\cap$ **PLS**.
[^R1]: **The RSA problem:** Find $M$ given the public key $(n,e)$ and a cipher text $C\equiv M^e\mod n$.
[^R2]: If we can solve the factoring problem then we can solve the RSA problem by factoring the modulus n. Hence, Factoring $\implies$ RSA.
[^primality]: The seminal result of Agarwal, Kayal, and Saxena showed that this problem is in **P**. See [this writeup](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~jaikumar/Papers/AKS-revised.pdf) for more details on the result.
[^EE]: **EE** equals DTIME($2^{2^{O(n)}}$).

[^PPA]:
    The **Complexity class PPA** (also known as **Polynomial Parity Argument**) captures computational search problems whose totality is rooted in the handshaking lemma for undirected graphs: "all graphs of maximum degree 2 have an even number of leaves."
    More precisely, **PPA** captures search problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given any string, computes its 'neighbor' strings (of which there are at most two). Then given a leaf string (i.e. one with only one neighbor), the problem is to output another leaf string.
