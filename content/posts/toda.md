Graph Reliability

Instance: A graph G and two its vertices s and t
Objective: How many subgraphs of G contains a path from s to t?

---

$\#$Matching

Instance: A graph G and two its vertices s and t
Objective: How many perfect matchings does G have?

---

$\#$SAT

Instance: A formula Φ in CNF
Objective: How many satisfying assignments does Φ have?
