# QTML 2022

Once thought to be a niche curiosity, the field of QML is growing astoundingly fast. QTML, or ''Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning'' is an annual conference that caters to its eponymous field. The conference describes itself as 'focused on the interplay between machine learning and quantum physics.' 

For an overview of various subfields of QML, check out [this survey article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23474) by Jacob Biamonte, Peter Wittek, Nicola Pancotti, Patrick Rebentrost, Nathan Wiebe, and Seth Lloyd from 2017. 

If you are more interested in the complexity-theoretic and learning-theoretic aspects, [this guest article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06806) by Arunachalam and Ronald de Wolf serves as a good introduction. Finally, I would like to list Peter Wittek's [magnum opus](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128009536/quantum-machine-learning) as a keystone in the foundation of the entire QML field.

This year was the sixth iteration of the conference, having been hosted earlier in Verona, Italy (2017), Durban, South Africa (2018), and Daejeon, South Korea (2019), with a couple of online fixtures due to the pandemic. The location for this year was at the Centro Congressi University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy, which is situated right on the coast across from the majestic Castel dell Ovo ([Castle of the Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_dell%27Ovo)). The conference lasted six days (7th-12th of November), with pre-conference and post-conference events and workshops.

Our paper on "Quantum Boosting using Domain-Partitioning Hypotheses" ([see preprint here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12793)) was selected for a short talk. In this work, we extend the [QAdaBoost](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05056) paper (which deals with weak learners producing only binary hypotheses) to a more general framework that allows us to adaptively boost weak learners that output the aforementioned "Domain-Partitioning Hypotheses". A natural example of these learners would be decision trees or any sort of clustering algorithms.

_The conference is happening at CERN next year!_

There were about a 100 attendees with participants mainly from Europe, some small groups from the US, South Africa, South Korea, and one Indian (me!). There was a good mix of industry (companies like Zapata, Xanadu, QuNova had sent in talks and representatives) and academia (with faculty, postdocs, PhDs, and a couple of undergrads). I was very excited to connect with a lot of QML folks, most of whom I had only stalked on arXiv thus far.

# QTML in Tweets

In this section I go over a few talks in the form of tweets (mainly because that is what the cool academics do in 2022!).

## The Peter Wittek Session

The Peter Wittek session consisted of a number of talks by distinguished speakers all of whom had personal anecdotes to share about Peter and their views on how he contributed to the nascent field of QML.

# Non-technical stuff

If you have stuck around thus far, the rest of the blog contains stuff about my travel and experiences in Italy.

## VISA struggles

The plight of COVID Ph.D.'s in terms of international travel is indescribable. More than just getting your paper accepted at a conference is required. You have to wait for all the threads of fate to align to be able to actually present the paper.

Italy has a (very weird) residential constraint for VISA applications. You can only be serviced by a VFS center that falls within your residential jurisdiction (i.e., your place of residence for the last six months). This makes the already daunting challenge of finding open slots at VFS centers nearly impossible to overcome. I got a slot for 21st October (purely by luck) at the Delhi center after the usual shenanigans of clicking refresh multiple times a day. The visa was processed quite fast - it took me less than five working days to receive the visa.

Next came the challenge of procuring Euro bills for the journey since a few seniors suggested that Italy was less digitized than India. What should have been a straightforward endeavor became an adventure in the dusty narrow corridors of the dilapidated buildings of Nehru Place. I set out to find agencies that could arrange cash on short notice (by the time I received the visa, I had less than a week till my flight to Rome.) The entire experience was highly shady, but surprisingly everything turned out alright.

## Getting there

I left for Rome on the night of 6th. Due to extremely short transit times (around 1.5 hrs) at Doha, I did not have the time to explore the airport much, but I managed to snag a pic with these two beauties.

After landing in Rome at the Fiumicino airport, I took a train to the Roma Terminus, and then another one to Napoli Centrale. The views of the Italian countryside with its gentle undulating hills and idyllic pastures seemed straight out of Tolkein's description of middle earth.

A word of advice for anyone travelling to Italy. You will find appropriate (daily/weekly) passes for travelling on the public transport at the local _Tabachchi's_ (cigarette shops). I recommend getting these, since public transit (buses, trams, metro) is good enough in both Rome and Naples to cover almost of all the local hotspots.

## Sightseeing and Food!

Even though Naples is primarily known for its eponymous styled pizza, Naples has a lot more to offer than just pizza! I could not carry out too detailed of an investigative tour of Rome's culinary scene this time, but I think the Trevi fountain cent has me covered for a return trip.

I also visited a few churches and castles in and around the city center during the evenings after the day's events ended. After the conference, I had a few days in hand before my return flight, which allowed me to visit the ruins of Pompeii (I booked a trip on TripAdvisor along with a group of fellow conference attendees) and carry out a whirlwind checklist tour in Rome. Enjoy the pics!

I am completely enamored with the Amalfi coast's beauty and counting the days until I return!

_I will keep adding stuff to this post, as and when I find time._
