# QTML 2022

Once thought to be niche curiosity, the field of QML is growing at an astounding pace. QTML or ''Quantum Techniques in Machine Learning'' is an annual conference that caters to its eponymous field. The conference describes itself as 'focused on the interplay between machine learning and quantum physics.'

This year was the sixth iteration of the conference having been hosted earlier in Verona (Italy), Durban (South Africa), and Daejeon (South Korea), with a couple of online fixtures due to the pandemic. The location for this year was at the Centro Congressi University of Naples Federico II in Naples, Italy, which is situated right on the coast across from the majestic Castel dell'Ovo ([Castle of the Egg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castel_dell%27Ovo)). The conference lasted for 6 days (7th-12th of November), with pre-conference and post-conference events and workshops.

_The conference is happening at CERN next year!_

There were about a 100 attendees with participants mainly from Europe, some small groups from the US, South Africa, South Korea, and one Indian (me!). There was a good mix of industry (companies like Zapata, Xanadu, QuNova had sent in talks and representatives) and academia (with faculty, postdocs, PhDs, and a couple of undergrads). I was very excited to connect with a lot of QML folks, most of whom I had only stalked on arXiv thus far.

<!-- Who – This is where you can start to bring your personal experience of the event into the post. Who was there? How many people attended? Were they from industry, academia or both? Were any ‘big names’ present? -->

<!-- When – The dates are essential of course, but it can be worth mentioning how frequent the event is. If it only happens every two years it will clearly carry more impact than if it takes places every few months. -->

<!-- Why – Why is the event happening? What is the purpose of it? The conference organisers will usually have some sort of strapline, and if you can’t improve on that yourself then it’s acceptable to put it in quote marks and attribute it accordingly. -->
