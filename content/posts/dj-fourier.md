In the late 1980's David Deutsch gave an algorithm that demonstrated quantum speedup for the first time when evaluating a particular property of boolean functions over $1$ bit. A few years later in 1992, David Deutsch and Richard Josza successfully extended the algorithm and its analysis to $n$ bits. The Deutsch-Josza algorithm also demonstrated one of the earliest ==exponential speedups== due to quantum algorithms.

Although, the Deutsch-Josza (abbreviated as DJ from now) algorithm applies to quite a contrived setting, it was instrumental in the development of the **â€œQuantum Fourier Sampling algorithm**.
